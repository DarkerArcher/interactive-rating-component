## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned how to use event listeners, which was a big thing for me. Reading/watching videos about a thing and actually using it are two very different things. So getting to use
them in the code was a real eye-opener. I also learned how to properly utilize functions, and arrow functions. I learned DOM manipulation, another big thing for me.


### Continued development

Moving forward, I definitely need to learn how to import javascript into another file. This was a major stumbling block for me and so the thank you state isn't complete.
I couldn't get my head around it so I decided to leave it.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing) - This helped me for understand events and event listeners.
